## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm *twifun*.
I'm a developer in **C** and soon **C++** (I kinda love the liberty that these languages give).

Since I was a *child*, I have loved **videogames**. Now I just want to share it with all of you!
I share the values of Free and Open-Source Software. I will share the majority of my projects under this license,
except my *heart project* that I will work on with all my *heart* to make this project **done**.

The first project that I will release is a small 2d game called *just throw it* under the **just1a-play *project***.
Soon : my personnal website
```c
printf("Thank you all\n");
joy++;
```
